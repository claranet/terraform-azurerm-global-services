## NOTE: About [/modules](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-azurerm-global-services/tree/master/modules) and [/examples](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-azurerm-global-services/tree/master/examples)

HashiCorp's Terraform Registry requires every repo to have a `main.tf` in its root dir. The Global Services code is broken down into multiple sub-modules, so they can't all be in the root dir [/](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-azurerm-global-services/tree/master). Therefore, Global services' sub-modules are in the [/modules](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-azurerm-global-services/tree/master/modules) subdirectory, the example code is in the [/examples](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-azurerm-global-services/tree/master/examples) subdirectory.
